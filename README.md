# moodle-format_iprestricted
Provides a "course format" that allows restricted access by IP address.

Choosing this course format for a course will restrict access to that course.

If you are browsing from an IP address that is not listed in the white list, you will be denied access to view that course.

# Usage
To restrict access to a course:
* choose the "IP Restricted" format for the course.
* Set the old course format to ...something
* Choose which IP addresses (and/or netblocks) should be "whitelisted"
* Done!
